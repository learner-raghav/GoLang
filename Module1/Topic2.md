1. Go belong to the C-family, like C++, Java and C# and it is inpired by many other languages created and used by its designers

2. The resembelance with the syntax of C language was maintained to gain an advantage among the developers.

3. Additioanlly, Go has features of a dynamic language, so Python and ruby programmers feel comfortable with it.

4. Go programming lanuage is influenced by a lot of concepts in other programming languages

5. Now, the important question is Why we need a new language. Following are the reasons that led to the development of GO
    
    1. Evolving with the computing landscape.
    2. Need for faster software development.
    3. Need for efficiency and ease of programming

6. Go is an attempt to combine the three wishes of 

    1. Efficient and fast compilation (Like interpreted languages)
    2. Fast execution (Like C/c++)
    3. Ease of programming (Like python)

7. The main target for golang's design was to combine the efficacy, speed and safety of a statically typed and compiled language 
    with the ease of programming of a dynamically typed language.

8. Other targets of Go were

    1. Support for network communication, concurrency and parallelizzation
    2. Support for excellent building speed. (We needed the building speed like CPP projects)
    3. Support for memory management. (Problem of memory leaks in C/CPP)
