1. The predefined functions which can be used without having to import a package to get access
    to them are called built-in functions.
   
2. They sometimes apply to different types , e.g. len, cap and append, or they have to operate near the system level like
    panic. So, they need support from the compiler.
   
3. len - This gives the length of a number of types.
    cap -  This is the maximum storage.
   
4. Sometimes, the solutions for bigger instances depend on the solution of smaller instances.
