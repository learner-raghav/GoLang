1. Functions in Go have a syntax that is very similar to many other languages
    `
        def funcName(var1 type1, var2 type2) int {

        }
    `

    This function accepts 2 arguments and return int as the type.


2. In go, we have single line comments that start with //, and multi line comments that start with /* */

3. Clean, readable and simple code are the major goals of GoLang! Therefore, the names of the variables in GO should be short, concise and evocative. Long names with mixed caps and underscores which are often seen in e.g. Java, Python etc sometime hinder the readability of the code.
